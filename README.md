# ECON30520 — Final Project  
### Determinants of Economics Students’ Final Exam Scores

This repository contains the full Quarto project for my ECON30520 assignment.  
The analysis explores the determinants of university economics students’ final exam performance using:

- **OLS regressions**
- **Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)**
- **Random Forest machine learning models**
- **Data cleaning, visualisation, and diagnostics in R**

The project uses a dataset of 856 students with variables covering academic performance, demographics, attendance, and standardised test scores.
